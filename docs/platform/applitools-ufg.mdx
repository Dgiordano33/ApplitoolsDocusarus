## What Is The Ultrafast Grid?

The [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid) provides an elegant and an ultra fast way to render pages in different browsers, viewports, and mobile simulators and emulators. It then takes screenshots and sends those screenshots to the Applitools AI server. With Ultrafast Grid you just need to run your test in a single browser but perform end-to-end and cross-browser tests in various browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, and also numerous combinations of viewports and in mobile simulators and emulators -- all in under a minute. Without Ultrafast Grid, you'll be wasting a lot of time and money running those tests in multiple browsers which could take hours and are error-prone.

And since Ultrafast Grid is integrated with our Eyes AI, you'll actually find a lot more functional and visual bugs than you'd normally find.

Further, you can use our [Root-Cause-Analysis (RCA)](https://applitools.com/root-cause-analysis) feature to figure out exactly which DOM element or CSS caused each difference! So you can go backwards, from the screenshot to the code!

**Best part**: All you need to do is to simply make `eyes.check` calls in your **existing Selenium tests** after adding our SDK and instantiating Ultrafast Grid. And that's all there is to it!

## How it works

Once you add and instantiate the Applitools SDK, simply add `eyes.check` calls wherever you want to check if the state of the page looks OK. Then run the Selenium test as usual. And while running the tests, anytime it encounters `eyes.check` (or similar methods), Applitools SDK uploads the DOM resource of that page to our [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid) behind the scenes and in batches. The Ultrafast Grid then renders every page in different browsers and mobile emulators (in parallel) and takes screenshots as per the configuration you set. Finally, it sends those screenshots to our AI Server.

When you first run the test,  our AI server simply stores those 1st set of screenshots as **Baseline images**. When you run the same test again, the AI server will compare the new set of screenshots, aka **Checkpoint images**, with the corresponding **Baseline images** and highlight bugs.

## Benefits
### Scale Your Testing Exponentially
Applitools AI enables organizations to verify their user interface at tremendous scale without requiring additional resources or work. Applitools reduces manual work across the entire testing process like test creation, analysis, maintenance, and execution and allows teams to test an exponential amount of their application. 

### Drastically Improve Test Coverage
Organizations can improve the test coverage of more of their applications across more browsers and devices that their customers are using without. Simply add Applitools to your current testing project or to any new features and workflows and youâ€™ll have 100% test coverage thanks to Visual AI.

### Proactively Monitor Your Frontend
Applitools allows teams to proactively validate their frontend and increase the number of visual, functional, and accessibility bugs found before production in a way not possible with traditional testing.
