[Applitools has SDKs](/#quickstart) for the all popular programming languages and test runners providing full test coverage for web, mobile, desktop, PDF, TV OS's, IoT, Images, and more.

## Benefits
### Scale Your Testing Exponentially
Applitools AI enables organizations to verify their user interface at tremendous scale without requiring additional resources or work. Applitools reduces manual work across the entire testing process like test creation, analysis, maintenance, and execution and allows teams to test an exponential amount of their application. 

### Drastically Improve Test Coverage
Organizations can improve the test coverage of more of their applications across more browsers and devices that their customers are using without. Simply add Applitools to your current testing project or to any new features and workflows and youâ€™ll have 100% test coverage thanks to Visual AI.

### Proactively Monitor Your Frontend
Applitools allows teams to proactively validate their frontend and increase the number of visual, functional, and accessibility bugs found before production in a way not possible with traditional testing.
