Applitools Native Mobile Grid is the next generation mobile-device cloud that allows testers and developers to automate testing of their mobile applications across different iOS and Android devices.

## Benefits
### Speed
The Native Mobile Grid is an incredible leap forward for engineering teams that need to ship quality mobile applications and updates in a short time. Teams can see their test execution time get cut by up to 90% by running their cross-device tests in our Native Mobile Grid. 
### Stability & Accuracy
Running your cross-device tests on Applitools Native Mobile Grid is the most stable, accurate way to test mobile devices as our AI enabled simulation grid drastically reduces the amount of false positives and flaky test runs. You can think of this as the most reliable testing infrastructure available. 
### Easier Analysis
Applitools automatically detects visual bugs across different devices in just seconds, helping you analyze your test results and reducing information overload. Many tools leave the reporting and analysis up to manual efforts - they help you run more tests in a faster time, but still leave you with thousands of bits of irrelevant test data. 
### Security
The Native Mobile Grid does not need to open a tunnel into your network so your application stays safe and secure
