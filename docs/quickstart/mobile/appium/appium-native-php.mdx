# Appium Native PHP Tutorial
The Applitools Eyes Appium PHP SDK allows you to easily add visual checkpoints to your PHP Appium tests. It takes care of getting screenshots of your application from the underlying WebDriver, sending them to the Eyes server for validation and failing the test in case differences are found.


## Install the SDK

```bash
composer require applitools/eyes.sdk.php
```

    If you don't have any installed packages create `composer.json` file and add the following.

    ```json
    {
        "require": {
            "applitools/eyes.sdk.php": "^1.3.3"
        }
    }
    ```
    And then run:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```


## Run your first test
Applitools Eyes reports differences by comparing screenshots of your application with baseline images that define the expected appearance of the application at each step of the test. By default, the Eyes SDK detects the environment in which the application is running (namely, the operating system, the type of browser and its viewport size) and compares the screenshots against baseline images that are specific to that environment. The first time you run a test in a given environment, its screenshots will be automatically saved as its baseline. Starting from the second run onward, you always have a baseline to compare against.

The test below is a simple Php program that visually validates the Hello World web-page at [https://applitools.com/helloworld](https://applitools.com/helloworld). It consists of two visual checkpoints, each validating the entire application window. The first time you run this test a new baseline will be created, and subsequent test runs will be compared to this baseline. If any screenshot mismatch its baseline image in a perceptible way, `eyes.close()` will throw a `DiffsFoundException` which includes a URL that points to a detailed report where you can see the detected differences and take appropriate actions such as reporting bugs, updating the baseline and more.

Before running the test, make sure to set the API key that identifies your account in the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` or directly assign it to the `$eyes->setApiKey()` property. You can find your API key under the user menu located at the right hand side of the test manager toolbar. If you don't yet have an account [create it now](https://applitools.com/sign-up) to obtain your key.

class HelloWorld

    protected $webDriver;

    public function demo()
    {
        // Initialize the eyes SDK and set your private API key.
        $eyes = new Eyes();
        $eyes->setApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY');

        // Setup appium - Make sure the capabilities meets your environment.
        // Refer to http://appium.io documentation if required.
        $capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        $capabilities->setCapability("deviceName", "iPhone 5");
        $capabilities->setCapability("platformName", "iOS");

        // The original app from Appium github project.
        $capabilities->setCapability("app", "https://applitools.jfrog.io/artifactory/Examples/eyes-ios-hello-world.zip");

        $driver = RemoteWebDriver::create("http://0.0.0.0:4723/wd/hub", $capabilities);

        try {

            // Start visual UI testing
            $eyes->open($driver, "iOS test application", "test");

            // Visual validation point #1
            $eyes->checkWindow("Initial view");
            $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::name("TextField1"))->sendKeys("3");
            $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::name("TextField2"))->sendKeys("5");
            $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::name("ComputeSumButton"))->click();

            // Visual validation point #2
            $eyes->checkWindow("After compute");

            // End visual UI testing. Validate visual correctness.
            $eyes->close();

        } finally {

            // Close the app.
            $this->webDriver->quit();

            // If the test was aborted before eyes->close was called,
            // ends the test as aborted.
            $eyes->abortIfNotClosed();

        }
    }
}

$test = new HelloWorld();
$test->demo();
```
