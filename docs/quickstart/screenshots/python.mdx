## Running Tests with Applitools

### Prerequisites

1. A [free Applitools account](https://applitools.com/users/register) and Applitools API KEY

  :::tip Tip: Unsure how to set up your API key?
  Learn how to get started at [Setting Up](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html)
  :::


2. Python 3 <https://realpython.com/installing-python/>
3. Git <https://git-scm.com>

  :::tip Note: Installing `git` is optional
  Installing git is used to clone the demo project from the Github repository. Instead of installing `git`, you can simply download the Zip file from the repository. Further, if you are Mac, you already have `git`.
  :::

### Running the Example Project

1. Clone or download the repository and navigate to that folder
```
git clone https://github.com/applitools/tutorial-images-python.git
cd tutorial-images-python
```
*Note: you can alternatively download the project as a Zip file and extract it*

2. Install the dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the example test
```
APPLITOOLS_API_KEY="[Your API Key]" pytest tutorial.py
```

### Adding Applitools Eyes to an Existing Project

Install Applitools Eyes dependencies:

```sh
pip install eyes-images
```

### Sample test

```python
import os
import io
import pytest
import requests
from PIL import Image

from applitools.images import Eyes, BatchInfo, logger

logger.set_logger(logger.StdoutLogger())

@pytest.fixture(name="eyes", scope="function")
def eyes_setup():
    """
    Basic Eyes setup. It'll abort test if wasn't closed properly.
    """
    eyes = Eyes()
    eyes.configure.batch = BatchInfo("Demo Batch - Images - Python")
    yield eyes
    # If the test was aborted before eyes.close was called, ends the test as aborted.
    eyes.abort()


def test_tutorial(eyes):
    # Start the session and set app name and test name.
    eyes.open("Demo App - Images Python", "Smoke Test - Images Python")

    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(requests.get("https://i.ibb.co/bJgzfb3/applitools.png").content))
    
    # Visual checkpoint #1.
    eyes.check_image(image)

    # End the test.
    eyes.close(False)
```
