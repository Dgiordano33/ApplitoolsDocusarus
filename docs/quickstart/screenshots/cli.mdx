The Applitools CLI Tool allows you to easily run visual UI tests on a collection of image files, by placing them inside a directory (also works with nested directory structure). It runs as a standalone jar file and can be invoked as a process by any programming language.

## Steps for running tests

1.    Download the latest `ImageTester.jar` file from here: [https://github.com/applitools/ImageTester](https://github.com/applitools/ImageTester)

:::tip Note
If you don't have your Applitools account yet, please [sign up first](https://applitools.com/users/register) and get your Applitools `API Key` that will be used next to execute the tests.

You can get the `API Key` by clicking on the Person Icon | "My API Key"
:::


2.    Add your `API Key` as an environment variable (optional, but recommended).

3.    Create a folder which will contain the images under test (let's say `/under_test`).

4.    Copy one batch of images into the `/under_test` folder

5.    Run the `ImageTester.jar` jar file as shown below:

```sh
java -jar ImageTester.jar -k $APPLITOOLS_API_KEY -f <PATH_TO>/under_test/
```

:::tip Note
The $APPLITOOLS_API_KEY is the environment variable name which contains the API key. You can instead just use **-k &lt;PASTE YOUR KEY&gt;**
:::

6.    This will create your baseline for the test.

7.    Copy the second images batch into the `under_test` folder.

8.    Run the `ImageTester` jar file (same as in #5)

9.    This will now create a checkpoint and compare against the baseline that was set in #5

10. Navigate to your dashboard to see the test results.

## Advanced options
The tool can be invoked on a single file or a complex folder structure with mixed content. The tool is built in Java and requires minimal set of parameters the minimal command will look as follow:

```bash
java -jar ImageTester.jar -k [api-key]
```


:::tip Note
 In the above, we are assuming that the images are in the same folder. If not, use `-f` to point to the target folder or file.
:::

\* In the minimal set of parameters will assume that the search folder is the execution folder.

+ Required parameters:
    + `-k [api-key]` - Applitools api key
+ Optional parameters and flags:
    + `-f [path]` - A path to target folder or file
    + `-a [app-name]` - Set the application name under directoryTest; default = ImageTester
    + `-p [http://proxy{,user,pass}]` - Set proxy and optional username + password
    + `-s [server]` - Set Applitools server url
    + `-ml [match-level]` - Set the comparison level, one from Strict/Content/Layout; Default = Strict
    + `-br [branch]` - Set the branch
    + `-pb [parent-branch]` - Set the parent branch
    + `-bn [baseline]` - Set custom baseline name
    + `-vs [WidthxHeight]` - Set the viewport size identifier
    + `-lf [log-file]` - Set log fine name to enable logging
    + `-os [osname]` - Set custom os
    + `-ap [browser name]` - Set browser or equivalent hosting application name
    + `-th [number]` - Specify max. concurrent workers (Threads). default= 3
    + `-fn [testName]` - Force all test names to be specific name. This will force all tests to be matched with a single baseline.
    + `-fb [batchName]` - Set unified flat batch to contain all the discovered tests regardless their hierarchy.
      + To add batch id to the flat batch use the following syntax:`-fb BATCH_NAME<>BATCH_ID`
    + `-sq [sequenceName]` - Set batch sequenceName for unified insights in applitools' dashboard.
    + `-ms [matchsize]` - Match the size of the images to a specific width and/or height ie. `1000x`- adjust by width, `x600`-adjust by height, `1000x600`- fit to the exact size (note, if both provided, may loose proportions)
    + `-nc` - Send batch notification on complete.
    + `-as` - Set automatic save on failures
    + `-st` - Split steps to individual tests
    + `-id` - Ignore displacement of shifting elements.
    + `-pn` - Prompt new tests, new tests will not be saved automatically, the user will have to review and save manually.
    + `-dv` - Disable SSL certificate validation. !!!Unsecured!!!


    ###### For Documents (PDFs) only
    + `-di [dpi]` - Set the quality of the conversion on PDF files
    + `-sp [pages]` - Comma separated page numbers\range to include in PDF testing (ie: 1,2,5,7,10-15); Default all included
    + `-pp [password]` - The password if the PDF files protected
    + `-pn` - Preserve original directory test names when specifying pages

## Enterprise features in combination with [Eyes Utilities](https://github.com/applitools/EyesUtilities)
By placing the Eyes-Utilities jar into the same folder as the ImageTester, new enterprise api features
made possible by providing an enterprise read-key.

```bash
java -jar ImageTester.jar -k [api-key] -vk [view-key] [options]
```

+ Required parameters:
    + `-k [api-key]` - Applitools api key
    + `-vk [view-key]` - Applitools enterprise view-key
+ Selective flags - Required one or more
    + `-gd` - Get diff images of the failed steps
    + `-gi` - Get images of the failed steps
    + `-gg` - Get animated gifs of the failed steps
+ Optional parameters and flags:
    + `-of [path]` - Specify custom output path or path-template

## Supporting regions
To validate only a specific regions of a particular image the folder must contain .regions file with the same name as the image.
ie. If my image file is 'step1.png' then the regions file should be 'step1.regions'.
Internally the format should be 4 columns csv in the following order: left,top,width,height

Here is an example of what can be step1.regions:
```
0,0,100,200
500,100,240,123
```
In order to include a capture of the entire image too, add an empty line as part of the regions list.
