```
$ git clone https://github.com/applitools/example-cypress-javascript-ufg.git
$ cd example-cypress-javascript-ufg
```

*Note: If you don't have Git installed,
then instead of running `git clone`,
you can [download the project as a ZIP file](https://github.com/applitools/example-cypress-javascript-ufg/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
and extract it.*


## Understanding the dependencies

The example project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management.
It contains the following dependencies for the 
[Applitools Eyes SDK for Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-cypress)
as well as Cypress itself:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@applitools/eyes-cypress": "^3.26.1",
    "cypress": "^9.7.0"
  }
```

:::tip Adding Applitools to Another Cypress Project?
This example project already has the Applitools Eyes SDK as a dependency.
If you want to add the Applitools Eyes SDK as a new dependency to another Cypress project,
run the following commands:

```
$ npm install @applitools/eyes-cypress
$ npx eyes-setup
```

## Understanding the code

The project contains one visual test case,
which is located at `cypress/integration/acme-bank.spec.js`.

`acme-bank.spec.js` is a Cypress test module that covers login behavior for the [ACME Bank demo web app](https://demo.applitools.com).
It uses the [Applitools Eyes SDK for Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-cypress)
to capture visual checkpoints.
The code is rather concise.
In-line comments explain every section.
Read it top to bottom to understand how it works:

```javascript
/// <reference types="cypress" />

// This test case spec contains everything needed to run a full visual test against the ACME bank site.
// The file `applitools.config.js` specifies how to run this test against multiple browsers in Applitools Ultrafast Grid.

// This "describe" method contains related test cases with per-test setup and cleanup.
// In this example, there is only one test.
describe('ACME Bank', () => {

    // This method performs setup before each test.
    beforeEach(() => {

        // Open Eyes to start visual testing.
        // Each test should open its own Eyes for its own snapshots.
        cy.eyesOpen({
            appName: 'ACME Bank',                       // The name of the app under test
            testName: Cypress.currentTest.title,        // The name of the test case
        })
    })

    // This test covers login for the Applitools demo site, which is a dummy banking app.
    // The interactions use typical Cypress calls,
    // but the verifications use one-line snapshot calls with Applitools Eyes.
    // If the page ever changes, then Applitools will detect the changes and highlight them in the dashboard.
    // Traditional assertions that scrape the page for text values are not needed here.
    it('should log into a bank account', () => {

        // Load the login page.
        cy.visit('https://demo.applitools.com')

        // Verify the full login page loaded correctly.
        cy.eyesCheckWindow({
            tag: "Login page",
            target: 'window',
            fully: true
        });

        // Perform login.
        cy.get('#username').type('andy')
        cy.get('#password').type('i<3pandas')
        cy.get('#log-in').click()

        // Verify the full main page loaded correctly.
        // This snapshot uses LAYOUT match level to avoid differences in closing time text.
        cy.eyesCheckWindow({
            tag: "Main page",
            target: 'window',
            fully: true,
            matchLevel: 'Layout'
        });
    })

    // This method performs cleanup after each test.
    afterEach(() => {
        
        // Close Eyes to tell the server it should display the results.
        cy.eyesClose()
    })
})
```

The `applitools.config.js` file in the project root directory
provides the configuration to run this visual test across multiple browsers in the Ultrafast Grid.
Its configuration applies to *all* test cases in the project:

```javascript
// This config file specifies how to run visual tests with Applitools.
// It applies to all tests in this project.

module.exports = {

    // Concurrency refers to the number of visual checkpoints Applitools will perform in parallel.
    // Warning: If you have a free account, then concurrency will be limited to 1.
    testConcurrency: 5,

    // To connect visual test results to your account,
    // you must set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to your Applitools API key.
    // To find it: https://applitools.com/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html
    // If you don't explicitly set the API key here,
    // then the SDK will automatically read the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to fetch it.
    apiKey: 'APPLITOOLS_API_KEY',
    
    // A batch is the collection of visual checkpoints for a test suite.
    // Batches are displayed in the dashboard, so use meaningful names.
    batchName: 'Applitools Example: Cypress JavaScript with the Ultrafast Grid',

    // Applitools can run checkpoints for snapshots against any browser in the Ultrafast Grid.
    // This setting defines 5 unique browser configurations to test.
    browser: [

        // Add 3 desktop browsers with different viewports for cross-browser testing in the Ultrafast Grid.
        // Other browsers are also available, like Edge and IE.
        {width: 800, height: 600, name: 'chrome'},
        {width: 1600, height: 1200, name: 'firefox'},
        {width: 1024, height: 768, name: 'safari'},

        // Add 2 mobile emulation devices with different orientations for cross-browser testing in the Ultrafast Grid.
        // Other mobile devices are available, including iOS.
        {deviceName: 'Pixel 2', screenOrientation: 'portrait'},
        {deviceName: 'Nexus 10', screenOrientation: 'landscape'},
    ]
}
```


## Preparing for test execution

Before running the visual test, you must [find your Applitools API key](https://applitools.com/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html) and set it as an environment variable named `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY`.

On macOS and Linux:

```
$ export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

On Windows:

```
> set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

::: tip Environment Variable Trouble
If you have trouble setting the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable,
you can hard-code your API key into `applitools.config.js` like this:

```java
// apiKey: 'APPLITOOLS_API_KEY',
apiKey: '<your-api-key>',
```

However, be warned: **hard-coding secrets is poor practice**.
Do this only temporarily for debugging,
and *never* commit hard-coded secrets to version control.
:::

::: tip Applitools Eyes Server
By default, tests will use the public Applitools Eyes server at `eyes.applitools.com`.
However, if your team is using a [private Applitools Eyes server](https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007189231-The-different-deployment-modes),
you can target it by setting the `APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL` environment variable.
:::

Next, you must install project dependencies and set up Applitools Eyes.
Run the following commands (which work for any OS):

```
$ npm install
$ npx eyes-setup
```


## Running the visual test

To open the Cypress window for launching tests, run:

```
$ npx cypress open
```

If you want to run tests directly from the command line, run this instead:

```
$ npx cypress run
```

Once your tests run, you should see results in the
[Applitools dashboard](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/test-manager/pages/tm-ui-overview.html).
For your batch, there should be 5 tests (one for each browser configuration),
each with 2 visual snapshots.

You can also change the web page to inject visual bugs:

```javascript
// cy.visit('https://demo.applitools.com')
cy.visit('https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html')
```

If you rerun the tests, then they should yield "unresolved" results for you to review.
Visual differences will be highlighted in magenta.
It's up to you to accept (üëç) or reject (üëé) the changes.
Applitools will remember your decisions for future analysis.
