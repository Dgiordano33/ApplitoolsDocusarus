# Tutorial: Playwright TypeScript with the Classic Runner

This tutorial will show you how to automate visual tests locally using the Applitools classic runner with Playwright in TypeScript.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Set up your local machine for testing.
2. Clone the example project repository.
3. Learn how to automate visual testing with Applitools Eyes.
4. Run the visual tests and review results in the Applitools dashboard.

After setting up your machine,
this tutorial should take **about 15 minutes** to complete.
If you get stuck along the way,
please [reach out to us for help](https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!

This tutorial focuses on running tests *locally* using the Applitools classic runner.
If you want to do cross-browser testing, then consider taking the
[Applitools Ultrafast Grid tutorial](./playwright-typescript-ufg.md).

::: tip Quickstart
If you prefer a quickstart instead of a full tutorial,
clone the [example repository](https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic)
and follow the [README](https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic/blob/master/README.md) instructions!
:::

::: tip JavaScript Support
This tutorial uses TypeScript, but the Applitools Eyes SDK for Playwright also works with JavaScript.
:::


## Recognizing project structure

The example project uses:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the programming language
* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation
* [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test) as the core test framework
* [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) as the local browser for testing
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management
* [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/platform/eyes/) for visual testing


## Setting up your machine

You'll need a few things to run this tutorial:

1. An [Applitools account](https://auth.applitools.com/users/register), which you can register for free.
2. A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. A good TypeScript editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript).


## Downloading the example project

The example project is located at
[https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic](https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic).
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic.git
$ cd example-playwright-typescript-classic
```

*Note: If you don't have Git installed,
then instead of running `git clone`,
you can [download the project as a ZIP file](https://github.com/applitools/example-playwright-typescript-classic/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
and extract it.*


## Understanding the dependencies

The example project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management.
It contains the following dependencies for the 
[Applitools Eyes SDK for Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-playwright)
as well as Playwright itself:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@applitools/eyes-playwright": "^1.12.1",
    "@playwright/test": "^1.22.2"
  }
```

::: tip Adding Applitools to Another Playwright Project?
This example project already has the Applitools Eyes SDK as a dependency.
If you want to add the Applitools Eyes SDK as a new dependency to another Playwright project,
run the following commands:

```
$ npm install --save-dev @applitools/eyes-playwright
```
:::


## Understanding the code

The project contains one visual test case,
which is located at `tests/acme-bank.spec.ts`.

`acme-bank.spec.ts` is a Playwright test module that covers login behavior for the [ACME Bank demo web app](https://demo.applitools.com).
It uses the [Applitools Eyes SDK for Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-playwright)
to capture visual checkpoints.
The code is rather concise.
In-line comments explain every section.
Read it top to bottom to understand how it works:

```javascript
// This test case spec contains everything needed to run a full visual test against the ACME bank site.
// It runs the test locally using the Applitools classic runner.
// If you want to run cross-browser visual tests, consider using the Ultrafast Grid.

import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { ClassicRunner, BatchInfo, Configuration, Eyes, Target } from '@applitools/eyes-playwright';

// Applitools objects to share for all tests
export let Runner: ClassicRunner;
export let Batch: BatchInfo;
export let Config: Configuration;

// This method sets up the configuration for running visual tests locally using the classic runner.
// The configuration is shared by all tests in a test suite, so it belongs in a `beforeAll` method.
// If you have more than one test class, then you should abstract this configuration to avoid duplication.
test.beforeAll(async() => {

  // Create the classic runner.
  Runner = new ClassicRunner();

  // Create a new batch for tests.
  // A batch is the collection of visual checkpoints for a test suite.
  // Batches are displayed in the dashboard, so use meaningful names.
  Batch = new BatchInfo({name: 'Applitools Example: Playwright TypeScript with the Classic Runner'});

  // Create a configuration for Applitools Eyes.
  Config = new Configuration();

  // Set the batch for the config.
  Config.setBatch(Batch);
});

// This "describe" method contains related test cases with per-test setup and cleanup.
// In this example, there is only one test.
test.describe('ACME Bank', () => {

  // Test-specific objects
  let eyes: Eyes;

  // This method sets up each test with its own Applitools Eyes object.
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {

    // Create the Applitools Eyes object connected to the VisualGridRunner and set its configuration.
    eyes = new Eyes(Runner, Config);

    // Open Eyes to start visual testing.
    // Each test should open its own Eyes for its own snapshots.
    // It is a recommended practice to set all four inputs below:
    await eyes.open(
      page,                             // The Playwright page object to "watch"
      'ACME Bank',                      // The name of the app under test
      test.info().title,                // The name of the test case
      { width: 1024, height: 768 });    // The viewport size for the local browser
  });
  
  // This test covers login for the Applitools demo site, which is a dummy banking app.
  // The interactions use typical Playwright calls,
  // but the verifications use one-line snapshot calls with Applitools Eyes.
  // If the page ever changes, then Applitools will detect the changes and highlight them in the dashboard.
  // Traditional assertions that scrape the page for text values are not needed here.
  test('log into a bank account', async ({ page }) => {

    // Load the login page.
    await page.goto('https://demo.applitools.com');

    // Verify the full login page loaded correctly.
    await eyes.check('Login page', Target.window().fully());

    // Perform login.
    await page.locator('id=username').fill('andy');
    await page.locator('id=password').fill('i<3pandas');
    await page.locator('id=log-in').click();

    // Verify the full main page loaded correctly.
    // This snapshot uses LAYOUT match level to avoid differences in closing time text.
    await eyes.check('Main page', Target.window().fully().layout());
  });
  
  // This method performs cleanup after each test.
  test.afterEach(async () => {

    // Close Eyes to tell the server it should display the results.
    await eyes.closeAsync();

    // Warning: `eyes.closeAsync()` will NOT wait for visual checkpoints to complete.
    // You will need to check the Applitools dashboard for visual results per checkpoint.
    // Note that "unresolved" and "failed" visual checkpoints will not cause the Playwright test to fail.

    // If you want the Playwright test to wait synchronously for all checkpoints to complete, then use `eyes.close()`.
    // If any checkpoints are unresolved or failed, then `eyes.close()` will make the Playwright test fail.
  });
});

test.afterAll(async() => {

  // Close the batch and report visual differences to the console.
  // Note that it forces Playwright to wait synchronously for all visual checkpoints to complete.
  const results = await Runner.getAllTestResults();
  console.log('Visual test results', results);
});
```


## Preparing for test execution

Before running the visual test,
you must [find your Applitools API key](https://applitools.com/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html)
and set it as an environment variable named `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY`.

On macOS and Linux:

```
$ export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

On Windows:

```
> set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

::: tip Environment Variable Trouble
If you have trouble setting the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable,
you can hard-code your API key into the test case
by adding the following line to the bottom of the `beforeAll` method:

```javascript
Config.setApiKey("<your-api-key>");
```

However, be warned: **hard-coding secrets is poor practice**.
Do this only temporarily for debugging,
and *never* commit hard-coded secrets to version control.
:::

::: tip Applitools Eyes Server
By default, tests will use the public Applitools Eyes server at `eyes.applitools.com`.
However, if your team is using a [private Applitools Eyes server](https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007189231-The-different-deployment-modes),
you can target it by setting the `APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL` environment variable.
:::

Next, you must install project dependencies and the Playwright browsers.
Run the following commands (which work for any OS):

```
$ npm install
$ npx playwright install
```


## Running the visual test

To launch the tests, run:

```
$ npx playwright test --project chromium
```

You can run against `firefox` and `webkit` instead of `chromium`.
In fact, you can run all three in parallel by removing the `--project` argument!

Once your tests run, you should see results in the
[Applitools dashboard](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/test-manager/pages/tm-ui-overview.html).
For your batch, there should be one test with two visual snapshots for each browser you target.

You can also change the web page to inject visual bugs:

```javascript
// await page.goto('https://demo.applitools.com');
await page.goto('https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html');
```

If you rerun the tests, then they should yield "unresolved" results for you to review.
Visual differences will be highlighted in magenta.
It's up to you to accept (👍) or reject (👎) the changes.
Applitools will remember your decisions for future analysis.
