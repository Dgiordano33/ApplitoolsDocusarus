# Playwright Tutorial

There are two ways to automate visual tests with Playwright:

1. Using the [Applitools Ultrafast Grid](./playwright-typescript-ufg.md)
2. Using the [Applitools Classic runner](./playwright-typescript-classic.md)

Your tests must use one or the other â€“ not both.
If you are new to Applitools and not sure which to pick,
read the sections below to help you decide.
Typically, **Ultrafast Grid is the recommended approach**.

::: tip Tutorial Links for Both Approaches
1. [Playwright TypeScript with the Ultrafast Grid](./playwright-typescript-ufg.md)
2. [Playwright TypeScript with the Classic Runner](./playwright-typescript-classic.md)

*Note:* These tutorials use TypeScript,
but the Applitools Eyes SDK for Playwright may also be used with JavaScript.

## Using the Ultrafast Grid

Using [Applitools Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/tutorials/overview/applitools-ultrafast-grid.html).
With this approach, you run your visual test one time locally,
and [`VisualGridRunner`](https://applitools.com/docs/api/eyes-sdk/index-gen/class-visualgridrunner-playwright-javascript.html)
uploads the visual snapshots to be rendered in the Ultrafast Grid against any browser configurations you specify.
You don't need to maintain different browser configurations yourself.
The Ultrafast Grid performs cross-browser testing much faster than local runs, too.

If you want to try the Ultrafast Grid,
take the tutorial for [Playwright TypeScript with the Ultrafast Grid](./playwright-typescript-ufg.md).


## Using the Classic Runner

With the [Classic runner](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/overview/overview-writing-tests-with-eyes-runner.html),
you capture visual snapshots on your local machine using
[`ClassicRunner`](https://applitools.com/docs/api/eyes-sdk/index-gen/class-classicrunner-playwright-javascript.html).
You are limited to testing only the browsers configured locally,
and you must run visual test instances for each browser you want to cover.

If you want to try the classic runner,
take the tutorial for [Playwright TypeScript with the Classic Runner](./playwright-typescript-classic.md).
