# Protractor and Applitools Tutorial
## ‚úÖ Prerequisites 

1. Create a [free Applitools account](https://applitools.com/users/register) and get the Applitools API KEY
 

2. Please set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable

    - Mac: `export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'`

    - Windows: `set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'`

    :::tip
    1. You may skip this step if you want to hard code the API KEY inside the tutorial project's code.
    2. It's better to store APPLITOOLS_API_KEY in the system variables (in Windows) or in the `~/.bash_profile` (in Mac) so that it is accessible from all Terminal shells
    :::

3. Install node.js from [https://nodejs.org‚Äã](https://nodejs.org)

4. Install git from [https://git-scm.com‚Äã](https://git-scm.com)

    :::tip
    Installing `git` is optional. You need this mainly to clone the demo project from the Github repository. Instead of installing `git`, you can simply download the Zip file from the repo. Further, If you are Mac, you already have `git`.
    :::

5. Install Google Chrome browser from [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

6. Install [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) on your machine and make sure it's is in the `PATH`.

  Below are some resources from the internet that'll help you

  * [Install on Mac](https://www.kenst.com/2015/03/installing-chromedriver-on-mac-osx/)
  * [Install on windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8)

## 5. üöÄ Run Tests

There are two main ways in which you can run tests.

The Applitools Ultrafast Grid (option 1) Test across all browsers and viewports 30-70 times faster than traditional test clouds. Using this approach, your tests will execute on a local browser once with the DOM, CSS, and additional artifacts captured by the SDK and sent to the Ultrafast Grid for parallel rendering and Visual AI comparison. This is the preferred execution method, however please note that it is a premium feature.

The second approach is to Run Local (option 2). This is the classic test execution in which your tests execute locally and each call to eyes via the SDK will send a screenshot to Eyes for Visual AI comparison.

While running tests using the classic approach is a great start - we recommend running tests on the Ultrafast Grid, the fastest way to ensure quality and consistency across all browsers, viewports, and devices.

### Option 1 - Run With The Ultrafast Grid


## 1. Introduction To the Ultrafast Grid
In real world testing, you'll need to test your app on multiple browsers, viewports and mobile devices. So you'll need to run and re-run ALL the tests in different browsers and multiple viewports to ensure things are fine - which could take hours and hours to complete. You may also encounter browsers not opening properly, or hanging and what not.

What if you could run in just one browser, just once, and still do cross-browser tests across various browsers, viewports and multiple mobile emulators? That's where [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid) comes in.

:::tip TL;DR
When you execute this tutorial, it'll run the test locally in Chrome browser but will show results in the following 5 combinations:

1. Chrome browser (800 X 600 viewport)
2. Chrome browser (700 X 500 viewport)
3. Firefox browser  (1200 X 800 viewport)
4. Firefox browser  (1600 X 1200 viewport)
5. An iPhone4 emulator

... all in ~30 seconds!‚è∞üöÄ

## 2. What Is The Ultrafast Grid?

The [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid) provides an elegant and an ultra fast way to render pages in different browsers, viewports and mobile simulators and then take screenshots and then send those screenshots to Applitools AI server. With Ultrafast Grid you just need to run your test in a single browser but perform end-to-end and cross-browser tests in various browsers such as Chrome,Firefox, IE, and also numerous combinations of viewports and in mobile simulators -- all in under a minute. Without Ultrafast Grid, you'll be wasting a lot of time and money running those tests in multiple browsers which could take hours and are error-prone.

And since Ultrafast Grid is integrated with our Eyes AI, you'll actually find a lot more functional and visual bugs than you'd normally find.

Further, you can use our [Root-Cause-Analysis (RCA)](https://applitools.com/root-cause-analysis) feature to figure out exactly which DOM element or CSS caused difference! So you can go backwards, from the screenshot to the code!

**Best part**: All you need to do is to simply make `eyes.check` calls in your **existing Selenium tests** after adding our SDK and instantiating Ultrafast Grid. And that's all there is to it!

## How it works
Once you add and instantiate the Applitools SDK, simply add `eyes.check` calls wherever you want to check if the state of the page looks OK. Then run the Selenium test as usual. And while running the tests, anytime it encounters `eyes.check` (or similar methods), Applitools SDK uploads the DOM resource of that page to our [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/ultrafast-grid) behind the scenes and in batches. The Ultrafast Grid then renders every page in different browsers and mobile emulators (in parallel) and takes screenshots as per the configuration you set. Finally, it sends those screenshots to our AI Server.

When you first run the test,  our AI server simply stores those 1st set of screenshots as **Baseline images**. When you run the same test again, the AI server will compare the new set of screenshots, aka **Checkpoint images**, with the corresponding **Baseline images** and highlights bugs.

## 3. Getting Started With The Ultrafast Grid
### Pre-requisites
1. Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Register to Applitools and have the APPlitools API Key
    * Get the API key by logging into Applitools > Person Icon > My API Key
3. Chrome Webdriver is on your machine and is in the `PATH`. Here are some resources from the internet that'll help you.

### Add to existing project

#### Install the SDK
```sh
npm install "@applitools/eyes-protractor" --save-dev
```

#### Example test
```js
'use strict';

const {
    VisualGridRunner,
    Eyes,
    Target,
    Configuration,
    RectangleSize,
    BatchInfo,
    BrowserType,
    DeviceName,
    ScreenOrientation,
    RunnerOptions
} = require('@applitools/eyes-protractor');

let eyes;

describe('protractor', function () {
    let runner

    beforeAll(async () => {
        browser.waitForAngularEnabled(false)

        // Create a runner with concurrency of 1
        const runnerOptions = new RunnerOptions().testConcurrency(5)
        runner = new VisualGridRunner(runnerOptions);

        // Create Eyes object with the runner, meaning it'll be a Visual Grid eyes.
        eyes = new Eyes(runner);

        // Initialize the eyes configuration
        const configuration = new Configuration();

        // You can get your api key from the Applitools dashboard
        // configuration.setApiKey('APPLITOOLS_API_KEY')

        // create a new batch info instance and set it to the configuration
        configuration.setBatch(new BatchInfo('Demo Batch - Protractor - Ultrafast'))

        // Add browsers with different viewports
        configuration.addBrowser(800, 600, BrowserType.CHROME);
        configuration.addBrowser(700, 500, BrowserType.FIREFOX);
        configuration.addBrowser(1600, 1200, BrowserType.IE_11);
        configuration.addBrowser(1024, 768, BrowserType.EDGE_CHROMIUM);
        configuration.addBrowser(800, 600, BrowserType.SAFARI);

        // Add mobile emulation devices in Portrait mode
        configuration.addDeviceEmulation(DeviceName.iPhone_X, ScreenOrientation.PORTRAIT);
        configuration.addDeviceEmulation(DeviceName.Pixel_2, ScreenOrientation.PORTRAIT);

        // Set the configuration to eyes
        eyes.setConfiguration(configuration);
    });


    it('ultraFastTest', async () => {

        // Navigate to the url we want to test
        // ‚≠êÔ∏è Note to see visual bugs, run the test using the above URL for the 1st run.
        // but then change the above URL to https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html
        // (for the 2nd run)
        await browser.get('https://demo.applitools.com');

        // Call Open on eyes to initialize a test session
        await eyes.open(browser, 'Demo App - Protractor - Ultrafast', 'Smoke Test - Protractor - Ultrafast', new RectangleSize(800, 600));

        // check the login page with fluent api, see more info here
        // https://applitools.com/docs/topics/sdk/the-eyes-sdk-check-fluent-api.html
        await eyes.check('Login Window', Target.window().fully());

        // Click the "Log in" button.
        element(by.id("log-in")).click();

        // Check the app page
        await eyes.check('App Window', Target.window().fully());

        // Call Close on eyes to let the server know it should display the results
        await eyes.close();
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
        // If the test was aborted before eyes.close was called, ends the test as aborted.
        await eyes.abort();

        // we pass false to this method to suppress the exception that is thrown if we
        // find visual differences
        const results = await runner.getAllTestResults();
        console.log(results);
    });

});
```
## Option 2 - Run Locally

## Run the demo app

1. Get the code:
    * Option 1: `git clone https://github.com/applitools/tutorial-protractor-basic.git`
    * Option 2: Download it as a [Zip file](https://github.com/applitools/tutorial-protractor-basic/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
2. cd `tutorial-protractor-basic` folder
3. Note: Remember to set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` env variable.
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run test`
6. After you run one set of tests, you now have the baseline. Run the same test but with this URL: `https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html`. This version of the demo app has some visual bugs so you can see how it all works. And the second set of screenshots are called "Checkpoint images". You can change the URL by opening the `/test/classic-runner-example.test.js` file.

## Add Applitools to an existing project

#### Installing the Eyes SDK

```js
npm install "@applitools/eyes-protractor" --save-dev
```
#### Example code

```js
'use strict';

const { Eyes, ClassicRunner, Target, RectangleSize, Configuration, BatchInfo} = require('@applitools/eyes-protractor');

describe('DemoApp - ClassicRunner', function () {
  beforeAll(() => {
    browser.waitForAngularEnabled(false)
  })

  let runner, eyes;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Initialize the Runner for your test.
    runner = new ClassicRunner();

    // Initialize the eyes SDK (IMPORTANT: make sure your API key is set in the APPLITOOLS_API_KEY env variable).
    eyes = new Eyes(runner);

    // Initialize the eyes configuration.
    const conf = new Configuration()

    // You can get your api key from the Applitools dashboard
    conf.setApiKey('APPLITOOLS_API_KEY')

    // set new batch
    conf.setBatch(new BatchInfo("Demo batch"));

    // set the configuration to eyes
    eyes.setConfiguration(conf)
  });

  it('Smoke Test', async () => {
    // Start the test by setting AUT's name, test name and viewport size (width X height)
    await eyes.open(browser, 'Demo App', 'Smoke Test', new RectangleSize(800, 600));

    // Navigate the browser to the "ACME" demo app.
    browser.get("https://demo.applitools.com");

    // To see visual bugs after the first run, use the commented line below instead.
    // await browser.get("https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html");

    // Visual checkpoint #1 - Check the login page.
    await eyes.check("Login Window", Target.window().fully());

    // This will create a test with two test steps.
    element(by.id("log-in")).click();

    // Visual checkpoint #2 - Check the app page.
    await eyes.check("App Window", Target.window().fully());

    // End the test.
    await eyes.close();
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    // If the test was aborted before eyes.close was called, ends the test as aborted.
    await eyes.abortIfNotClosed();

    // Wait and collect all test results
    const allTestResults = await runner.getAllTestResults();
    console.log(allTestResults);
  });
});
```
