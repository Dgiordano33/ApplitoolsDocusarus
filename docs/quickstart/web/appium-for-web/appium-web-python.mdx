# Appium Web Python Tutorial
The Applitools Eyes Appium Python SDK allows you to easily add visual checkpoints to your Python Appium tests. It takes care of getting screenshots of your application from the underlying WebDriver, sending them to the Eyes server for validation and failing the test in case differences are found.


## Install the SDK

```
pip install eyes-selenium
```

## Run your first test

Applitools Eyes reports differences by comparing screenshots of your application with baseline images that define the expected appearance of the application at each step of the test. By default, the Eyes SDK detects the environment in which the application is running (namely, the operating system, the type of browser and its viewport size) and compares the screenshots against baseline images that are specific to that environment. The first time you run a test in a given environment, its screenshots will be automatically saved as its baseline. Starting from the second run onward, you always have a baseline to compare against.

The test below is a simple Python program that visually validates the Hello World web-page at https://applitools.com/helloworld. It consists of two visual checkpoints, each validating the entire application window. The first time you run this test a new baseline will be created, and subsequent test runs will be compared to this baseline. If any screenshot mismatch its baseline image in a perceptible way, `eyes.close()` will throw a DiffsFoundError which includes a URL that points to a detailed report where you can see the detected differences and take appropriate actions such as reporting bugs, updating the baseline and more.

Before running the test, make sure to set the API key that identifies your account in the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` or directly assign it to the `eyes.api_key` property. You can find your API key under the user menu located at the right hand side of the test manager toolbar. If you don't yet have an account [create it now](https://applitools.com/sign-up) to obtain your key.

### IOS Simulator

```python

from selenium import webdriver
from applitools.selenium.eyes import Eyes

class HelloWorld:

    # Initialize the eyes SDK and set your private API key.
    eyes = Eyes()
    eyes.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

    # Set the desired capapbilities, be sure to change the values accordingly
    desired_caps = {}
    desired_caps['platformName'] = 'iOS'
    desired_caps['browserName'] ='Safari'
    desired_caps['deviceName'] = 'DEVICE_NAME'
    desired_caps['platformVersion'] = '10.1'
    desired_caps['automationName'] = 'XCUITest'

    # Open browser
    driver = webdriver.Remote('http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub', desired_caps)

    try:

        # Start the test.
        eyes.open(driver=driver, app_name='Hello World!', test_name='My first Appium web Python test!')

        # Navigate the browser to the "Hello World!" web-site.
        driver.get(r'https://applitools.com/helloworld')

        # Visual validation point #1.
        eyes.check_window('Hello!')

        # Click the "Click me!" button.
        driver.find_element_by_tag_name('button').click()

        # Visual validation #2.
        eyes.check_window('Click!')

        # End the test.
        eyes.close()

    finally:

        # Close the browser.
        driver.quit()

        # If the test was aborted before eyes.Close was called, end the test as aborted.
        eyes.abort_if_not_closed()

```

### Android (Real Device)

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from applitools.eyes import Eyes

class HelloWorld:

    # Set the desired capapbilities, be sure to change the values accordingly
    desired_caps = {}
    desired_caps['platformName'] = 'Android'
    desired_caps['platformVersion'] = 'PLATFORM_VERSION'
    desired_caps['browserName'] = 'BROWSER_NAME'
    desired_caps['deviceName'] = 'DEVICE_NAME'

    # Initialize the eyes SDK and set your private API key.
    eyes = Eyes()
    eyes.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

    try:

        driver = webdriver.Remote('http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub', desired_caps)

        # Start the test.
        eyes.open(driver=driver, app_name='Hello World!', test_name='My first Appium web Python test!')

        # Navigate the browser to the "hello world!" web-site.
        driver.get(r'https://applitools.com/helloworld')

        # Visual checkpoint #1.
        eyes.check_window('Hello!')

        # Click the 'Click me!' button.
        driver.find_element_by_tag_name('button').click()

        # Visual checkpoint #2.
        eyes.check_window('Click!')

        # Close eyes.
        eyes.close()

    finally:

        # Close the browser.
        driver.quit()

        # If the test was aborted before eyes.close was called, ends the test as aborted.
        eyes.abort_if_not_closed()
```
