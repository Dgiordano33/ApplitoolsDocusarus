# Windows UFT Tutorial

The Applitools Eyes UFT/QTP SDK allows you to easily add visual checkpoints to your UFT/QTP tests. It takes care of getting screenshots of your application from the underlying UFT, sending them to the Eyes server for validation and failing the test in case differences are found.


## Install the SDK
1. Download the [latest SDK of Applitools Eyes for UFT](https://applitools.jfrog.io/artifactory/UFT_SDK/) and extract it into a folder of your choice.

2. Associate the `Eyes.qfl` function library located in the extracted folder with your test in `File > Settings > Resources > +`.

3. If you want Eyes to be included in all tests, make sure to check `‘Set As Default’`

## Run your first test
Applitools Eyes reports differences by comparing screenshots of your application with baseline images that define the expected appearance of the application at each step of the test. By default, the Eyes SDK detects the environment in which the application is running (namely, the operating system, the executable name and its window size) and compares the screenshots against baseline images that are specific to that environment. The first time you run a test in a given environment, its screenshots will be automatically saved as its baseline. Starting from the second run onward, you always have a baseline to compare against.

The test below is a simple UFT/QTP program that visually validates the default notepad program, before and after it types some text into it. It consists of two visual checkpoints, each validating the entire application window. The first time you run this test a new baseline will be created, and subsequent test runs will be compared to this baseline. If any screenshot mismatch its baseline image in a perceptible way, `eyes.Close()` will throw a `DiffsFoundException` which includes a URL that points to a detailed report where you can see the detected differences and take appropriate actions such as reporting bugs, updating the baseline and more.

Before running the test, make sure to set the API key that identifies your account in the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` or directly assign it to the `eyes.api_key` property. You can find your API key under the user menu located at the right hand side of the test manager toolbar. If you don't yet have an account [create it now](https://applitools.com/sign-up) to obtain your key.

```VB
' Make sure to include 'Eyes.qfl' via File -> Settings... -> Resources

' This is your api key, make sure you use it in all your tests.
eyes.ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

' Test setup - You should have 'Notepad' window object in your objects repository
Set testApp = Window("Notepad")
eyes.SetBaselineInfoFromWindow(testApp)

' Start visual UI testing - Open eyes test
eyes.Open "Hello World", "QTP Hello World Test"

' Visual checkpoint #1
eyes.CheckObject testApp, "Hello!"

' Write something
testApp.WinEditor("Edit").Type("Applitools UFT Demo")

' Visual checkpoint #2
eyes.CheckObject testApp, "Write!"

' End visual UI testing. Validate visual correctness.
eyes.Close()

' Report
If Not eyesReport.IsPassed Then
    If eyesReport.IsNew Then
        Reporter.ReportEvent micFail, eyesReport.TestName, "New test inserted, See " & eyesReport.Url & " for details."
    else
        Reporter.ReportEvent micFail, eyesReport.TestName, "See " & eyesReport.Url & " for details."
    End If
End If
```
