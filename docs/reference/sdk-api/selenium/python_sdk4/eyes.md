This class provides the main methods used to execute tests and checkpoints.

Import statement

    from applitools.selenium import Eyes
    	



### Eyes method
#### Syntax


    eyes = Eyes(runner)
    
    eyes = Eyes()
    

#### Parameters

runner

Type: Union\[Text,[VisualGridRunner](./visualgridrunner),[ClassicRunner](./classicrunner),None\] \[Optional : default = None \]

If this parameter is provided, it must be an instance of either the [ClassicRunner](./classicrunner) or [VisualGridRunner](./visualgridrunner) classes. If a [VisualGridRunner](./visualgridrunner) is passed then the image will be rendered using the Ultrafast Grid. If this parameter is not provided, then DOM rendering is done using the local browser defined by the driver parameter passed to the [Eyes.open](#open-method) method.

#### Return value

Type:  None

Use the object returned to call the various methods provided by the Eyes class.

Note: This method is a static method.

Note that this feature is available as both a method and a property.

#### Parameters

driver

Type: AnyWebDriver

The driver returned from the call to open.

#### Type definitions

The type ViewPort is defined as: Union\[Dict\[Text,int\],[RectangleSize](./rectanglesize)\]

### locate method
#### Syntax


    names_a = ["locator_1a", "locator_1b", "locator_1c"]

#### Parameters

visual_locator_settings

Type: [VisualLocatorSettings](./visuallocatorsettings)

An object that defines the required visual locator names and how many instances of each locator should be found. This object is created using a series of calls on a [VisualLocator](./visuallocator) object in a fluent API style. See the example below for more details.

#### Return value

Type:  LOCATORS_TYPE

Returns a mapping between the locator names passed as a parameter [name](#name-method) or [names](#names-method) methods and the regions in the viewport where the graphic images defined by those locator names were detected.

If the image of a particular locator name is not found in the viewport, the locator is mapped to a zero length array. If a locator name is passed, and a locator of that name has not been defined on the Eyes server, the returned locator will be mapped to a value of None instead of an array.

and each value is an object that contains the text found and its bounding rectangle.

#### Type definitions

LOCATORS_TYPE

A mapping of each locator to the region identified for that locator.

#### Remarks


The article [Visual locators](https://applitools.com/docs/features/visual-locators.html) describes in detail how to associate locator names with graphic images and how to search for instances of the graphic in the browser viewport. The example below is a briefer description of how to search for instances of the locator graphics.

#### Example


The example below includes two calls to the method [Eyes.locate](#). These calls illustrate two ways to specify the visual locators and two ways to specify how many locators to return.

Two ways of specifying visual locators are:

*   Pass a locator string to the method [name](#name-method).
*   Pass a list of strings to the method [names](#names-method).

You can call these methods multiple times to specify multiple locators names or multiple lists of locator names.

To specify how many regions to return per locator, append one of the following methods:

*   To retrieve a maximum of one region for each locator append a call to [first](#first-method).
*   To retrieve all regions for all locators append a call to ([all](#all-method)).

Python

    # return a zero or one locator for each of the three locators defined as parameters to name()
    loc_regions_6 = eyes.locate(
        (VisualLocator.name("locator_a")
            .name("locator_b")
            .name("locator_c")
            .first()))
    # return all the locator found for the locators defined in the lists passed to names() or Strings passed to name()                   
    locator_list_1 = ["locator_1a", "locator_1b", "locator_1c"]
    locator_list_2 = ["locator_2a", "locator_2b", "locator_2c"]
    loc_regions_7 = eyes.locate(
        (VisualLocator.names(locator_list_1)
            .names(locator_list_1)
            .name("another locator")
            .all()))
    
    locators_regions = eyes.locate(VisualLocator.names(["locator_a", "locator_b", "locator_c"]).all())
    # Loop through all the locators and click on the center of their region
    for locator_info in locators_regions:
        for locator, region in locator_info:
            x = region.left + region.width/2
            y = region.top + region.height/2
            print("loc = ", locator, " x = ", x, " y = ", y)

//...

### open method
#### Syntax


    outdriver = eyes.open(driver, app_name, test_name, viewport_size)
    
    outdriver = eyes.open(driver, app_name, test_name)
    
    outdriver = eyes.open(driver, app_name)
    
    outdriver = eyes.open(driver)
    

#### Parameters

driver

Type: AnyWebDriver

The web driver.

#### Type definitions

AnyWebDriver

The type AnyWebDriver is defined as: Union\[EyesWebDriver,WebDriver\]. This object can be used in the same way as the Selenium driver object.

app_name

Type: Text \[Optional : default = None \]

The application name. This may be any string. You can set the application name for all tests using the [Configuration.set_app_name](./configuration#set_app_name-method) method or [Eyes.app_name](app_name-property) property. If you do so, then set this parameter to a value of None to indicate that the configuration default should be used.

test_name

Type: Text \[Optional : default = None \]

The name of the test. This name must be unique within the scope of the application name. It may be any string.

viewport_size

Type: ViewPort \[Optional : default = None \]

The size of the viewport

The size of the viewport passed as an object.

The size of the viewport passed as an object {'width':, 'height':}

Defines the viewport size of the browser that will be set before the start of the test. If this parameter is not provided then the viewport size will be based on the current browser window size. See [Using viewports in Eyes](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html) for more details.

Passing a value of None specifies that the default viewport size should be used. If [Eyes.set_viewport_size](#set_viewport_size-method) is called before the call to this method, then the default is determined by the value set by that method. If it is not called, then the default viewport size is system and application dependent.

#### Type definitions

ViewPort

The type ViewPort is defined as: Union\[Dict\[Text,int\],[RectangleSize](./rectanglesize)\]

#### Return value

Type:  EyesWebDriver

The returned web driver is a clone of the driver passed as a parameter. It is recomended that you use the web driver object returned by this method in all further calls to the web driver. This allows Eyes to record these interactions and play them back in the Eyes Test Manager.

#### Remarks


After making a call to this method, you must eventually terminate the test by calling [Eyes.close_async](#close_async-method) (in case of a normal completion) or [Eyes.abort_async](#abort_async-method) (in case of an aborted test). If you want to run another test, then it is recomended to do this with a newly created Eyes instance to avoid side effects. However, in principle, it is legal to call [Eyes.Open](#open-method) again to start a new test on the same Eyes instance.

### set_configuration method
#### Syntax


    value = eyes.set_configuration(configuration)
    

#### Parameters

configuration

Type: [Configuration](./configuration)

A configuration object that has the various properties/methods set to the required values.

#### Return value

Type:  None

#### Remarks


The typical sequence for configuring a test is:

*   Create a [Configuration](./configuration) object.
*   Assign to the properties you want to set up, and call the various methods.
*   Create an [Eyes](./eyes) instance.
*   Call the [Eyes.set_configuration](#) method with the configuration object.
*   Call the [Eyes.open](#open-method) method to start the test session.

Once you've changed the configuration of an Eyes instance by calling [Eyes.set_configuration](#) or by setting a configuration directly on the Eyes instance, if you want to change the configuration, you must use the following sequence:

*   Get the current configuration using [Eyes.get_configuration](#get_configuration-method) to a local variable.
*   Make changes to the local configuration value.
*   Assign the local configuration object to the Eyes instance using [Eyes.set_configuration](#).

### set_viewport_size method
#### Syntax


    value = Eyes.set_viewport_size(driver, size)
    Eyes.viewport_size  = value
    python_sdk4: eyes.viewport_size Warning : void return value None on overload - ignored - assumed its a private setter.

Note: This method is a static method.

Note that this feature is available as both a method and a property.

#### Parameters

driver

Type: AnyWebDriver

The driver returned from the call to open.

#### Type definitions

AnyWebDriver

The type AnyWebDriver is defined as: Union\[EyesWebDriver,WebDriver\]. This object can be used in the same way as the Selenium driver object.

size

Type: ViewPort

The size of the viewport

The size of the viewport passed as an object.

The size of the viewport passed as an object {'width':, 'height':}

#### Type definitions

ViewPort

The type ViewPort is defined as: Union\[Dict\[Text,int\],[RectangleSize](./rectanglesize)\]

#### Return value

Type:  None

#### Remarks


*   Call this method before the call to [Eyes.open](#open-method). Then, when calling the open method, don't pass the viewportSize parameter. If the viewport size is set to be smaller than the actual content, then scrolling should typically be enabled by calling [set_force_full_page_screenshot](./configuration#set_force_full_page_screenshot-method) method so that the full page image is tested.

This method is a static method.
