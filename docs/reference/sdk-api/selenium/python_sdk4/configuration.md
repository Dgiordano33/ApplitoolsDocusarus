This class is used to create a configuration object that is used to configure an [Eyes](./eyes) object by passing it to the [Eyes.set_configuration](./eyes#set_configuration-method) method.

You can use this configuration object instead of using the various [Eyes](./eyes) methods and properties that set the same attributes. Typically you set up a Configuration object by calling its setXXXX methods chained with a '.' in a Fluent coding style. In this class, some attributes can be set by both a property and a set command. The properties allow you simple direct access to assign to and retrieve the attribute. The corresponding set method allows you to set multiple attributes using a Fluent style.

Import statement

    from applitools.selenium import Configuration
    	



### Configuration method
#### Syntax


    config = Configuration()
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  None

The value returned is the object that called the method. This allows you to use a fluent style to call the `setXXXX` methods of the [Configuration](./configuration) class.


### ignore_caret property
#### Syntax


    configval = config.ignore_caret
    

Type: bool

#### Remarks


We recommend using [set_hide_caret](#set_hide_caret-method) since this eliminates cursor related artifacts instead of detecting and ignoring them.

### ignore_caret property
#### Syntax


    configval = config.ignore_caret
    

Type: bool

### is_send_dom property
#### Syntax


    configval = config.send_dom
    

Type: bool

### accessibility_validation property
#### Syntax


    config.accessibility_validation  = configval
    configval = config.accessibility_validation

    configval = config.api_key
    

Type: Text

A string that is your API Key.

#### Remarks


Set this immediately after the Eyes object is created (before calling [open](#open-method)). If you have an environment variable called APPLITOOLS_API_KEY that is set to the value of your API key, then you do not need to call this method, and Eyes will take the string from the environment value.

#### Syntax


    config.app_name  = configval
    configval = config.app_name
    

Type: Text

The application name to be configured for the test.

Type: Tuple\[[VisualGridOption](./visualgridoption)\]

#### Remarks


The following configuration key/value pairs are currently supported:

'chromeHeadless'

Normally, the Ultrafast Grid renders its images using Headless Chrome. There are cases where the behavior of Headless Chrome is different from that of regular Chrome browser, and if the baseline was created with a regular Chrome browser, the differences will be found. Set this option to a value of False to instruct the Ultrafast Grid to use a regular Chrome browser instead of the Headless Chrome browser, so as to eliminate differences that arise because of the different types of Chrome browser.

'polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets'

Adopted Stylesheets are a way to create and distribute reusable styles when using a Shadow DOM. Adopted Stylesheets are not supported by all browsers, so their use may cause mismatches when doing cross-browser validation. By default, when the Ultrafast Grid detects that a page being checked uses Adopted Stylesheets, it will not render that checkpoint, the check will fail, and the test will be aborted. In the Test Manager, the test results for that run will have an Aborted status, and the step that failed will have a Missing status.

To enable rendering of checkpoints that include Adopted Stylesheets, and to ensure that the test can complete successfully, you need to explicitly set the Ultrafast Grid option polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets to a value of True or False:

*   Setting a value of True instructs the Ultrafast Grid to polyfill Adopted Stylesheets.
*   Setting a value of False instructs the Ultrafast Grid to render the page without polyfilling Adopted Stylesheets.

You can set this option globally using the method [Configuration.set_visual_grid_options](#set_visual_grid_options-method)

You can override the global value for a given checkpoint using the method [SeleniumCheckSettings.visual_grid_options](./checksettings#visual_grid_options-method).

### wait_before_screenshots property
#### Syntax


    config.wait_before_screenshots  = configval
    configval = config.wait_before_screenshots
    

Type: int

The time to wait in milliseconds. Passing a value of less than or equal to zero will cause the default value to be used.


### add_browser method
#### Syntax


    configval = config.add_browser(desktop_browser_info)
    
    configval = config.add_browser(ios_device_info)
    
    configval = config.add_browser(chrome_emulation_info)
    
    configval = config.add_browser(width, height, browser_type)
    
    configval = config.add_browser(width, height, browser_type, baseline_env_name)

            # ... other configurations    
         )  
        #
        # Assign the configuration to all newly created Eyes instances
        #
        eyes = Eyes(runner)
        eyes.set_configuration(suite_config) 

width

Type: int

The width of the browser viewport for this target. The maximum viewport width for all browsers is 5120. If this limit is exceeded, then execution of the checkpoint will fail.

Use this in conjunction with the browser_type parameter.

height

Type: int

The height of the browser viewport for this target. There is no height limit.

Use this in conjunction with the browser_type parameter.

browser_type

Type: [BrowserType](./browsertype)

The type of browser for this target.

Python

    # test suite setup  
        suite_config = (Configuration()  
            .add_browser(viewport_width, viewport_height, BrowserType.CHROME)  
            # ... other configurations

        #
        eyes = Eyes(runner)
        eyes.set_configuration(suite_config) 

baseline_env_name

Type: Text

The name of the baseline environment. If provided, then the viewport, host app (browser), and OS that define the baseline are defined by the baseline environment name and not by the execution environment. The name should already be defined in the Test Manager. If it is not defined, then it will be created based on the execution environment of the first test that uses that name. For more information see [Running cross-environment tests](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/working-withcross-environment-tests.html).

Use this in conjunction with the browser_type parameter.

#### Return value

Type:  [Configuration](./configuration)

The value returned is the object that called the method. This allows you to use a fluent style to call the `setXXXX` methods of the [Configuration](./configuration) class.

#### Remarks


By default, the entire page is rendered. The viewport width and height parameters impact the baseline that is chosen, unless the baseline environment configuration has been provided. The viewport passed to the [Eyes.open](#open-method) method does not impact the baseline used, but could impact the page layout if the page has any viewport size-sensitive factors such as HTML, CSS or Javascript.

#### Parameters

options

Type: [VisualGridOption](./visualgridoption)

One or more configuration options for the Ultrafast Grid.

#### Return value

Type:  [Configuration](./configuration)

#### Remarks


The following configuration key/value pairs are currently supported:

'chromeHeadless'

Normally, the Ultrafast Grid renders its images using Headless Chrome. There are cases where the behavior of Headless Chrome is different from that of regular Chrome browser, and if the baseline was created with a regular Chrome browser, the differences will be found. Set this option to a value of False to instruct the Ultrafast Grid to use a regular Chrome browser instead of the Headless Chrome browser, so as to eliminate differences that arise because of the different types of Chrome browser.

'polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets'

Adopted Stylesheets are a way to create and distribute reusable styles when using a Shadow DOM. Adopted Stylesheets are not supported by all browsers, so their use may cause mismatches when doing cross-browser validation. By default, when the Ultrafast Grid detects that a page being checked uses Adopted Stylesheets, it will not render that checkpoint, the check will fail, and the test will be aborted. In the Test Manager, the test results for that run will have an Aborted status, and the step that failed will have a Missing status.

To enable rendering of checkpoints that include Adopted Stylesheets, and to ensure that the test can complete successfully, you need to explicitly set the Ultrafast Grid option polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets to a value of True or False:

*   Setting a value of True instructs the Ultrafast Grid to polyfill Adopted Stylesheets.
*   Setting a value of False instructs the Ultrafast Grid to render the page without polyfilling Adopted Stylesheets.

You can set this option globally using the method [Configuration.set_visual_grid_options](#)

You can override the global value for a given checkpoint using the method [SeleniumCheckSettings.visual_grid_options](./checksettings#visual_grid_options-method).

#### Example


Python

    # test suite setup  
        suite_config = (Configuration()  
            .set_visual_grid_options(VisualGridOption("polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets", True))  
            # ... other configurations    
         )  
        #
        # Assign the configuration to all newly created Eyes instances
        #
        eyes = Eyes(runner)
        eyes.set_configuration(suite_config)
