Type: EyesWebDriver

### is_open property
#### Syntax


    value = eyes.is_open
    

Type: bool

Return True if the [Eyes.open](#open-method) method has been called on an eyes instance, and [Eyes.close](#close-method) or [Eyes.abort_if_not_closed](#abort_if_not_closed-method) have not yet been called.

### check_region method
#### Syntax


    value = eyes.check_region(region, tag, match_timeout, target, stitch_content)
    
    value = eyes.check_region(region, tag, match_timeout, target)
    
    value = eyes.check_region(region, tag, match_timeout)
    
    value = eyes.check_region(region, tag)
    
    value = eyes.check_region(region)
    

#### Parameters

region

Type: [Region](./region)

A non-empty region representing the screen region to check in screenshot pixel coordinates.

tag

Type: Text \[Optional : default = None \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

match_timeout

Type: int \[Optional : default = -1 \]

The retry time in milliseconds. If there is a mismatch, then Eyes will recapture and recheck the checkpoint until the timeout limit. This can help avoid mismatches in cases where the capture was done before the page was fully rendered. Passing a value of -1 will force the default timeout.

target

Type: [Target](./target) \[Optional : default = None \]

An object that defines floating and ignores regions and other configuration options.

stitch_content

Type: bool \[Optional : default = False \]

If the application window is larger than the viewport, and this parameter is True, then the entire page content is rendered. If this parameter is False, then only the viewport is rendered.

#### Return value

Type:  None

### check_region_by_element method
#### Syntax


    value = eyes.check_region_by_element(element, tag, match_timeout, target, stitch_content)
    
    value = eyes.check_region_by_element(element, tag, match_timeout, target)
    
    value = eyes.check_region_by_element(element, tag, match_timeout)
    
    value = eyes.check_region_by_element(element, tag)
    
    value = eyes.check_region_by_element(element)
    

#### Parameters

element

Type: AnyWebElement

An element whose position and bounding rectangle defines the region.

tag

Type: Text \[Optional : default = None \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

match_timeout

Type: int \[Optional : default = -1 \]

The retry time in milliseconds. If there is a mismatch, then Eyes will recapture and recheck the checkpoint until the timeout limit. This can help avoid mismatches in cases where the capture was done before the page was fully rendered. Passing a value of -1 will force the default timeout.

target

Type: [Target](./target) \[Optional : default = None \]

An object that defines floating and ignores regions and other configuration options.

stitch_content

Type: bool \[Optional : default = False \]

If the application window is larger than the viewport, and this parameter is True, then the entire page content is rendered. If this parameter is False, then only the viewport is rendered.

#### Return value

Type:  None

    value = eyes.check_window(tag)
    
    value = eyes.check_window()
    

#### Parameters

tag

Type: Text \[Optional : default = None \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager.

    result = eyes.close()
    

#### Parameters

raise_ex

Type: bool \[Optional : default = True \]

If this parameter has a value of True, then if there are new, missing, or mismatched steps, an exception will be thrown. If the parameter is set to False, then an exception will not be thrown for the above cases. If the parameter is not passed, then it is as if a True value was passed.

#### Return value

Type:  [TestResults](./testresults)

The result of the test can be obtained from the object returned. See [TestResults class](./testresults) for a list of what information can be obtained from this object. See [TestResults class](./testresults) for a list of what information can be obtained from this object.

### get_viewport_size method
#### Syntax


    value = eyes.get_viewport_size()
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  ViewPort

The viewport size in the form {'width': 800, 'height': 600}.

### open method
#### Syntax


    outdriver = eyes.open(driver, app_name, test_name, viewport_size)
    
    outdriver = eyes.open(driver, app_name, test_name)
    

#### Parameters

driver

Type: AnyWebDriver

The web driver.

app_name

Type: Text

The application name. This may be any string.

test_name

Type: Text

The name of the test. This name must be unique within the scope of the application name. It may be any string.

viewport_size

Type: ViewPort \[Optional : default = None \]

The size of the viewport

The size of the viewport passed as an object.

The size of the viewport passed as an object {'width':, 'height':}

Defines the viewport size of the browser that will be set before the start of the test. If this parameter is not provided then the viewport size will be based on the current browser window size. See [Using viewports in Eyes](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html) for more details.

Passing a value of None specifies that the default viewport size should be used. If [Eyes.set_viewport_size](#set_viewport_size-method) is called before the call to this method, then the default is determined by the value set by that method. If it is not called, then the default viewport size is system and application dependent.

#### Return value

Type:  EyesWebDriver

The returned web driver is a clone of the driver passed as a parameter. It is recomended that you use the web driver object returned by this method in all further calls to the web driver. This allows Eyes to record these interactions and play them back in the Eyes Test Manager.

#### Remarks


After making a call to this method, you must eventually terminate the test by calling [Eyes.close](#close-method) (in case of a normal completion) or [Eyes.abort_if_not_closed](#abort_if_not_closed-method) (in case of an aborted test). If you want to run another test, then it is recomended to do this with a newly created Eyes instance to avoid side effects. However, in principle, it is legal to call [Eyes.Open](#open-method) again to start a new test on the same Eyes instance.

### set_viewport_size method
#### Syntax


    value = Eyes.set_viewport_size(size)
    

Note: This method is a static method.

#### Parameters

size

Type: AnyWebDriver \[Optional : default = None \]

The size of the viewport

The size of the viewport passed as an object.

The size of the viewport passed as an object {'width':, 'height':}

#### Return value

Type:  None

#### Remarks


*   Call this method before the call to [Eyes.open](#open-method). Then, when calling the open method, don't pass the viewportSize parameter. If the viewport size is set to be smaller than the actual content, then scrolling should typically be enabled by calling [force_full_page_screenshot](#force_full_page_screenshot-property) property so that the full page image is tested.

This method is a static method.
