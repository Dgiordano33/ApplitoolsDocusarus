This class provides the main methods used to execute tests and checkpoints.

Using statement

    using Applitools.Images;
    	



### Eyes method
#### Syntax


    Eyes eyes = new Eyes();
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  [Eyes](./eyes)

Use the object returned to call the various methods provided by the Eyes class.


### IsOpen property
#### Syntax


    bool value = eyes.IsOpen;
    

Type: bool

Return true if the [Eyes.Open](./eyes#open-method) method has been called on an eyes instance, and [Eyes.Close](./eyes#close-method), [Eyes.Abort](./eyes#abort-method), [Eyes.AbortAsync](./eyes#abortasync-method) or [Eyes.AbortIfNotClosed](./eyes#abortifnotclosed-method) have not yet been called.

### AgentId property
#### Syntax


    string value; // give relevant initial value
    eyes.AgentId  = value;
    value = eyes.AgentId

Type: string

#### Remarks


To take effect, this property must be assigned before the call to [Open](./eyes#open-method).

### ApiKey property
#### Syntax


    string value; // give relevant initial value
    eyes.ApiKey  = value;
    value = eyes.ApiKey

Type: string

#### Remarks


Set this immediately after the Eyes object is created (before calling [Open](./eyes#open-method)). If you have an environment variable called APPLITOOLS_API_KEY that is set to the value of your API key, then you do not need to call this method, and Eyes will take the string from the environment value.

### AppName property
#### Syntax


    string value; // give relevant initial value
    eyes.AppName  = value;
    value = eyes.AppName

Type: string

#### Remarks


If you call this method, it must be called before the call to [Eyes.Open](./eyes#open-method). In the call to [Eyes.Open](./eyes#open-method), if you provide the application parameter, then it will override the value set here. If you don't provide the parameter or pass a null, then the value set here will be used.

### BaselineBranchName property

#### Remarks


Set this property once before the calls to the [Open](./eyes#open-method) method for all tests that are supposed to be part of this batch.

### BranchName property
#### Syntax


    string value; // give relevant initial value
    eyes.BranchName  = value;
    value = eyes.BranchName

    value = eyes.ScaleRatio

Type: double

### SendDom property
#### Syntax


    bool value; // give relevant initial value
    eyes.SendDom  = value;
    value = eyes.SendDom

Type: bool

#### Remarks


Sending DOM information is enabed by default, so use this method only if you have to disable it.

### ServerUrl property
#### Syntax


    eyes.ServerUrl  = new System.Uri('https://myEyesServer'); //setter
    System.Uri uri = eyes.ServerUrl;                          //getter

Type: string

#### Syntax


    RectangleSize value; // give relevant initial value
    Eyes.ViewportSize  = value;
    value = Eyes.ViewportSize

Type: [RectangleSize](./rectanglesize)

#### Remarks


*   Call this method before the call to [Eyes.Open](./eyes#open-method). Then, when calling the open method, don't pass the viewportSize parameter.

This method is a static method.


### Abort method
#### Syntax


    TestResults value = eyes.Abort();
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  [TestResults](./testresults)

#### Remarks


If you call this method on a test that was opened but not closed, then then test will have an aborted status in the Eyes Test Manager. If you call it after the test has been succesfully closed, then the call is ignored.

### AbortAsync method
#### Syntax


    eyes.AbortAsync();

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  void

#### Remarks


If you call this method on a test that was opened but not closed, then then test will have an aborted status in the Eyes Test Manager. If you call it after the test has been succesfully closed, then the call is ignored.

### AbortIfNotClosed method
#### Syntax


    TestResults value = eyes.AbortIfNotClosed();
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  [TestResults](./testresults)

#### Remarks


If you call this method on a test that was opened but not closed, then then test will have an aborted status in the Eyes Test Manager. If you call it after the test has been succesfully closed, then the call is ignored.

### AddProperty method
#### Syntax


    eyes.AddProperty(name, value);

#### Parameters

name

Type: string

The name of the property.

value

Type: string

The value associated with the name.

#### Return value

Type:  void

#### Remarks


*   You should not assign a given value to a property more than once in a given test run.
*   You can also associate properties with a batch using [BatchInfo.AddProperty](./batchinfo#addproperty-method).

### Check method
#### Syntax


    AppImage value = eyes.Check(name, checkSettings);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.Check(checkSettings);
    

#### Parameters

name

Type: string

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

checkSettings

Type: ICheckSettings

The fluent API calls, starting with one of the [Target](./target) methods.

#### Return value

Type:  [AppImage](./appimage)

This method returns an object with a boolean property [IsMatch](./appimage#ismatch-property). If this property has a value of true indicates that the checkpoint matched, or is a new checkpoint. The meaning of a return value of false depends on whether this is the first checkpoint to return this value or not. For the first checkpoint that returns a value of false, the implication is that there was a mismatch. The test may choose to recapture the image and resend it (when using a check that supports this feature). Once one checkpoint has returned false, all the following checkpoints will also return false. This does not mean that the checkpoint mismatched; it means that Eyes will only know the final status of the checkpoint at the end of the test. If required, the actual result of the checkpoint should be obtained from the [StepInfo](./stepinfo) object in the [TestResults](./testresults) returned by the [Close](./eyes#close-method) method.

#### Remarks


For a detailed description of how to use this method see [The Eyes SDK check Fluent API](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/sdk/the-eyes-sdk-check-fluent-api.html).

### CheckImage method
#### Syntax


    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image, tag, replaceLast);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image, tag);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image64, tag, replaceLast);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image64, tag);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImage(image64);
    
    
    
    

#### Parameters

image

Type: Bitmap

An image stored in a buffer in PNG format.

tag

Type: string \[Optional : default = null \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

replaceLast

Type: bool \[Optional : default = false \]

If the value of this paramter is true then the image from this checkpoint should be used instead of the previous checkpoint image. This is typically used to implement a retry mechanism, when the previous check method returns a mismatch.

image64

Type: string

The image in base64 encoded image format.

image

Type: byte\[\]

The image as a byte stream (as it appears in the PNG image file).

#### Return value

Type:  [AppImage](./appimage)

This method returns an object with a boolean property [IsMatch](./appimage#ismatch-property). If this property has a value of true indicates that the checkpoint matched, or is a new checkpoint. The meaning of a return value of false depends on whether this is the first checkpoint to return this value or not. For the first checkpoint that returns a value of false, the implication is that there was a mismatch. The test may choose to recapture the image and resend it (when using a check that supports this feature). Once one checkpoint has returned false, all the following checkpoints will also return false. This does not mean that the checkpoint mismatched; it means that Eyes will only know the final status of the checkpoint at the end of the test. If required, the actual result of the checkpoint should be obtained from the [StepInfo](./stepinfo) object in the [TestResults](./testresults) returned by the [Close](./eyes#close-method) method.

### CheckImageAtUrl method
#### Syntax


    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageAtUrl(url, tag, replaceLast);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageAtUrl(url, tag);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageAtUrl(url);
    

#### Parameters

url

Type: string

url

tag

Type: string \[Optional : default = null \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

replaceLast

Type: bool \[Optional : default = false \]

If the value of this paramter is true then the image from this checkpoint should be used instead of the previous checkpoint image. This is typically used to implement a retry mechanism, when the previous check method returns a mismatch.

#### Return value

Type:  [AppImage](./appimage)

This method returns an object with a boolean property [IsMatch](./appimage#ismatch-property). If this property has a value of true indicates that the checkpoint matched, or is a new checkpoint. The meaning of a return value of false depends on whether this is the first checkpoint to return this value or not. For the first checkpoint that returns a value of false, the implication is that there was a mismatch.

If required, the actual result of the checkpoint should be obtained from the [StepInfo](./stepinfo) object in the [TestResults](./testresults) returned by the [Close](./eyes#close-method) method.

### CheckImageFile method
#### Syntax


    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageFile(path, tag, replaceLast);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageFile(path, tag);
    
    AppImage value = eyes.CheckImageFile(path);
    

#### Parameters

path

Type: string

tag

Type: string \[Optional : default = null \]

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

replaceLast

This does not mean that the checkpoint mismatched; it means that Eyes will only know the final status of the checkpoint at the end of the test. If required, the actual result of the checkpoint should be obtained from the [StepInfo](./stepinfo) object in the [TestResults](./testresults) returned by the [Close](./eyes#close-method) method.

### CheckRegion method
#### Syntax


    AppImage value = eyes.CheckRegion(image, region, tag);
    

#### Parameters

image

An image stored in a buffer in PNG format.

region

Type: Rectangle

A non-empty region representing the screen region to check in screenshot pixel coordinates.

tag

Type: string

The tag defines a name for the checkpoint in the Eyes Test Manager. The name may be any string and serves to identify the step to the user in the Test manager. You may change the tag value without impacting testing in any way since Eyes does *not* use the tag to identify the baseline step that corresponds to the checkpoint - Eyes matches steps based on their content and position in the sequences of images of the test. See [How Eyes compares checkpoints and baseline images](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/how-eyes-compares-checkpoints.html) for details.

#### Return value

Type:  [AppImage](./appimage)

This method returns an object with a boolean property [IsMatch](./appimage#ismatch-property). If this property has a value of true indicates that the checkpoint matched, or is a new checkpoint. The meaning of a return value of false depends on whether this is the first checkpoint to return this value or not.

This does not mean that the checkpoint mismatched; it means that Eyes will only know the final status of the checkpoint at the end of the test. If required, the actual result of the checkpoint should be obtained from the [StepInfo](./stepinfo) object in the [TestResults](./testresults) returned by the [Close](./eyes#close-method) method.

### ClearProperties method
#### Syntax


    eyes.ClearProperties();

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  void

### Close method
#### Syntax


    TestResults result = eyes.Close();
    
    TestResults result = eyes.Close(throwEx);
    

#### Parameters

throwEx

Type: bool

If this parameter has a value of true, then if there are new, missing, or mismatched steps, an exception will be thrown. If the parameter is set to false, then an exception will not be thrown for the above cases. If the parameter is not passed, then it is as if a true value was passed.

#### Return value

Type:  [TestResults](./testresults)

The result of the test can be obtained from the object returned. See [TestResults class](./testresults) for a list of what information can be obtained from this object. See [TestResults class](./testresults) for a list of what information can be obtained from this object.

### GetConfiguration method
#### Syntax


    Configuration value = eyes.GetConfiguration();
    

#### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

#### Return value

Type:  [Configuration](./configuration)



### Open method
#### Syntax


    eyes.Open(appName, testName, viewportSize);
    eyes.Open(appName, testName);

#### Parameters

appName

Type: string

The application name. This may be any string. You can set the application name for all tests using the [Configuration.SetAppName](./configuration#setappname-method) method or [Eyes.AppName](./eyes#appname-property) property. If you do so, then set this parameter to a value of null to indicate that the configuration default should be used.

testName

Type: string

The name of the test. This name must be unique within the scope of the application name. It may be any string.

viewportSize

Type: Size

The size of the viewport

The size of the viewport passed as an object.

The size of the viewport passed as an object {'width':, 'height':}

Defines the viewport size of the browser that will be set before the start of the test. If this parameter is not provided then the viewport size will be based on the current browser window size. See [Using viewports in Eyes](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html) for more details.

#### Return value

Type:  void

#### Remarks


After making a call to this method, you must eventually terminate the test by calling [Eyes.Close](./eyes#close-method) (in case of a normal completion) or [Eyes.AbortAsync](./eyes#abortasync-method) (in case of an aborted test). If you want to run another test, then it is recomended to do this with a newly created Eyes instance to avoid side effects. However, in principle, it is legal to call [Eyes.Open](#open-method) again to start a new test on the same Eyes instance.

### SetConfiguration method
#### Syntax


    eyes.SetConfiguration(configuration);

#### Parameters

configuration

Type: IConfiguration

A configuration object that has the various properties/methods set to the required values.

#### Return value

Type:  void

#### Remarks


The typical sequence for configuring a test is:

*   Create a [Configuration](./configuration) object.
*   Assign to the properties you want to set up, and call the various methods.
*   Create an [Eyes](./eyes) instance.
*   Call the [Eyes.SetConfiguration](#) method with the configuration object.
*   Call the [Eyes.Open](./eyes#open-method) method to start the test session.

Once you've changed the configuration of an Eyes instance by calling [Eyes.SetConfiguration](#) or by setting a configuration directly on the Eyes instance, if you want to change the configuration, you must use the following sequence:

*   Get the current configuration using [Eyes.GetConfiguration](./eyes#getconfiguration-method) to a local variable.
*   Make changes to the local configuration value.
*   Assign the local configuration object to the Eyes instance using [Eyes.SetConfiguration](#).

### SetTitle method
#### Syntax


    eyes.SetTitle(title);

#### Parameters

title

Type: string

The text of the title.

#### Return value

Type:  void
