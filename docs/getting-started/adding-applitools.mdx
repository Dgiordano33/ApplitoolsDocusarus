title: Installing Applitools
---

Applitools easily integrates with your existing tests â€“ no need to create new tests or learn new frameworks. With a single snippet of code, Applitools Eyes captures and analyzes an entire screen of your application.

Applitools SDKs support all major automated testing frameworks and allow you to easily take screenshots of pages, elements, regions or iFrames and upload them along with DOM snapshots to the Applitools Eyes server. Our Visual AI then compares them with previous test executions' screenshots (aka Baselines) and reports if there is a bug or not. It's that simple!
